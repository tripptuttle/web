I study Human-AI Interaction (HAII). I am particularly interested in the opaque, sociotechnical infrastructures that undergird intelligent systems – particularly web search. My research is generously supported in my studies by a <a href="https://gradschool.unc.edu/funding/gradschool/royster/">Caroline H. and Thomas S. Royster Fellowship</a>. 

In addition to my research, I am currently working on the <a href="https://ncpfastnetwork.com">NC PFAS Testing Network</a>, developing a data management portal with the Data Science team at <a href="https://renci.org">RENCI</a>. Prior to graduate school, I was UNC’s Fulbright program adviser and a global program manager at the <a href="https://cgi.unc.edu">UNC Center for Global Initiatives</a>.
